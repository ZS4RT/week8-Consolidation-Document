#Consolidation Document - Module 2 Zain Shoaib 101203253

I've been thinking alot about what counts as a sucess and what counts as a fail in this course. I found the through week 5 and 6, I'm starting to question whether just doing the activities counts as a win, when im not fully engaging with the archeaological meaning behind what I am doing. I spent a lot of time wasting just looking at my screen waiting to start.

In Week 5, I worked on archaeo-stats-in-R.ipynb, analzying Pottery, RBPottery, Handaxes dataset. I learbed to see and calculate average and data summaries, make tables and charts, and test if patterns where real or random. I could see that LLanedyrn had over half the pottery samples, but did'nt spend enough time thinking about what that sampling bias meant. I alsi built SQL queires in intro-sql.ipynb. I learned how to ask questions of data using SQL, filter and sort information, connect different tables, and count and average data. But when I encountered problems like wrong column names or joining tables with mismatched names, I focused more on fixing the errors than understanding why the data was structured that way in the first place.

Instead of spending time studying what everything accomplishes, I kept wasting time on basic technical mistakes in Week 6.  I used the nodes.csv and edges.csv files to generate network visualizations in roman-networks.ipynb and performed agent-based simulations in abm-on-roman-network.ipynb, abm-foraging.ipynb, and virus-on-a-network.ipynb.  However, I had to spend hours resolving file path issues for data loading, missing library imports in Python notebooks, and installation errors for R's NetLogoR package.  

My most frustrating mistakes were caused by getting caught in these pointless technical loops. Instead of approaching these exercises as questions to investigate, I was approaching them as technical challenges to solve. I failed to consider why I was utilizing the tools in the first place since I was so preoccupied with getting them to function. The turning point for me was when I started thinking about our graveyard project through the lens of what I'd learned in both weeks. I wondered what biases we might induce in our own cemetery record after discovering statistical biases in the pottery data from Week 5. I started to wonder what relationships between graves we might be overlooking by concentrating just on what is easily measurable after reading the network analysis from Week 6. I discovered that digital preservation produces its own absences when I browsed public cemetery databases and noticed innumerable "abandoned old cemetery" listings with little information

My greatest achievement was realizing that the goal of digital archaeology is to use digital tools to ask better questions rather than to achieve technological perfection.  I learned from all those hours I spent troubleshooting basic coding and installation faults that often the most worthwhile work is produced when you put aside the technical issues and begin to consider the original motivation behind the task.  The time I spent researching abandoned cemeteries online proved to be more beneficial than any flawlessly written code because it made me realize that every technical decision we make, from the design of SQL databases to the way networks are visualized, influences which stories are revealed and which are kept hidden.
